^CMake Warning \(dev\) at .*/Modules/ExternalProject.cmake:[0-9]+ \(message\):
  Policy CMP0114 is not set: ExternalProject step targets fully adopt their
  steps.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0114" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  ExternalProject target 'FOO' would depend on the targets for step\(s\)
  'do_something' under policy CMP0114, but this is being left out for
  compatibility since the policy is not set.
