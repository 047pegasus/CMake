cmake-default-dir-install-permissions
-------------------------------------

* The :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS` variable was added
  to enable setting of default permissions for directories created implicitly
  during installation of files by :command:`install` and
  :command:`file(INSTALL)`.
