CMP0083
-------

To control generation of Position Independent Executable (``PIE``) or not, some
flags are required at link time.

CMake 3.13 and lower did not add these link flags when
:prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` is set.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to not manage ``PIE`` link flags. The
``NEW`` behavior is to add link flags if :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`
is set:

* Set to ``TRUE``: flags to produce a position independent executable are
  passed to the linker step. For example ``-pie`` for ``GCC``.
* Set to ``FALSE``: flags not to produce a position independent executable are
  passed to the linker step. For example ``-no-pie`` for ``GCC``.
* Not set: no flags are passed to the linker step.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.14.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
