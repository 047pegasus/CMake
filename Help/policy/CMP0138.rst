.. versionadded:: 3.24

Placeholder for reverted policy.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.24. Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.
